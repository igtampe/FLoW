    <p>Bonjour!<br />
        <br />
        Welcome to FLOW, a port of ViBE for an ASP.NET website. Its fully functional with the ViBE Server, and that server in turn is fully compliant with the old TEBECON Standard. Feel free to do your UMSWEB Financial transactions with FLOW!</p>
<p>&nbsp;If you&#39;re on a desktop I&#39;d recommend downloading ViBE instead, since there are a few limitations on FLOW. For starters, the directory isn&#39;t dynamic. Its just a static listbox because ASP doesn&#39;t like re-rendering VB Items.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Still tho if you need to make quick payments or just check your balances, its perfectly usable. Thanks for using it!</p>
